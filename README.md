# Journey to the Cloud and beyond
A chronicle of my journey one Byte at a time

My hope is to be a source of inspiration

## Goal - Set up a blog to host my journey
1. Open Source
   - Hosted on Github.io
   - Golang based Blog platform - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
   - Manage the Blog with Docker with automated updates triggered by git commits
      - Considering AWS codebuild
   - Manage Infrastucture as Code (IaC)
     - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
1. Build and manage the blog 99% using an ipad.
   - It can be done.
